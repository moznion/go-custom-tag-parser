A simple parser for golang's struct custom tags.

You don't have to use this library. You should use [reflect.StructTag](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#StructTag) instead of this.

This library's processing time is slower than reflect's one.

__There is only one reason for using this library, this has a feature to check the syntax of custom tag (in strict mode, `Parse()` returns an error when a custom tag is an invalid syntax).__

Synopsis
--

### with strict mode

It raises an error when an unacceptable custom tag is given on parsing.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/moznion/go-struct-custom-tag-parser"
)

func main() {
	result, err := tagparser.Parse(`foo:"bar" buz:"qux,foobar"`, true)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("unexpected error has come: %s", err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", result) // => map[foo:bar buz:qux,foobar]
}
```

### with no strict mode

It immediately returns the processed results until just before the invalid custom tag syntax. It never raises any error.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/moznion/go-struct-custom-tag-parser"
)

func main() {
	result, _ := tagparser.Parse(`foo:"bar" buz:"qux,foobar"`, false)
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", result) // => map[foo:bar buz:qux,foobar]
}
```
